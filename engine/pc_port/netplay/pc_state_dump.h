// Netplay desync forensics (issue #1037): per-tick object records of the
// simulation state the seven-column state hash covers, kept in a ring so a
// desync report can name the objects that differ and dump their fields for the
// tick where the peers first disagreed (the desync is only reported several
// frames later).
//
// Read-only. Nothing here writes sim state, calls the sim RNG or changes the
// hash columns: the walkers mirror pc_state_hash.cpp field for field and
// rebuild the same FNV-1a byte stream, so the records reproduce the navi, piki,
// teki, item and world sub-hashes exactly. pc_state_dump_capture() compares its
// rebuilt columns with the real ones; a mismatch is logged once (the dump then
// would not cover what the hash covers). Also computes `xtra`, a separate
// hash over sim fields the seven columns do not mix (see
// pc_netplay_forensics.h); it is not part of the total and GekkoNet never
// sees it.
//
// Netplay build only (the session calls it after pc_state_hash_tick_end()).
// Cost: one extra read-only walk of the live objects per tick and one memcpy
// of ~100 B per object into the ring; off unless enabled.
