// Netplay M5c lane B (issue #887): session stats and adaptive input delay.
// Engine-free, header-only policy pieces that pc_netplay_session.cpp drives,
// so the host-run test (pc_netplay_adaptive_test.cpp) links nothing else.
//
// Measure first. SessionStats keeps, per session and per peer:
//   - stall events: one event is a run of consecutive session turns that
//     produced no Advance while the session was running (not a frozen B1
//     HOLD). Count, total ms, max ms, and the events of the last 10 s;
//   - presented frames: the wall time between two consecutive Advances (each
//     Advance runs one tick, whose presentation pass swaps one frame), as a
//     0.1 ms histogram with exact values above 500 ms (p50/p95/p99/max);
//   - RTT: GekkoNet's last_ping for the remote peer, sampled every 500 ms
//     (its NetworkHealth ping runs every 500 ms), p50/p95 and jitter (mean
//     absolute difference of successive samples, GekkoNet's own definition).
//
// Adaptive delay. The local input delay d is how many frames ahead of the
// current frame a local input lands. The remote peer at frame c needs this
// peer's input for c, which this peer produced d frames earlier, so d must
// cover the one-way trip of this peer's inputs plus the phase by which the
// remote's 30 Hz schedule leads this peer's (the frames-ahead correction
// leaves up to 0.75 frame). When it does not, the REMOTE waits: its stalls
// measure this peer's delay, and this peer's stalls measure the remote's.
// (Measured on the first jitter run: the leading host logged 85 stall events,
// 712 ms, the joiner 4, 45 ms; a rule on local stalls raised the wrong peer's
// delay.) So each peer reports its own counted stalls to the other over the
// handshake channel (a small unreliable "advice" datagram every 250 ms with
// cumulative totals, so a lost one costs nothing), and each peer's controller
// runs on the stalls the REMOTE reports:
//   - up quickly: reported lateness inside the last upWindowMs (3 s), and
//     not before settleMs (0.8 s) after the last change (earlier reports
//     still describe inputs sent before it), of at least upStallMs (100 ms)
//     raises d by 1 (by 2 when it is three times that over at least three
//     late events: sustained, not one spike), at most once per upCooldownMs
//     (1 s). A raise stops at need(RTT p50) + maxExtraOverRtt (2), so stalls
//     that no delay can fix (a peer that cannot hold 30 Hz) cost at most two
//     frames;
//   - down slowly: downHoldMs (15 s) since the last change with at most
//     downStallTolMs (50 ms) of reported lateness inside it, reports arriving
//     throughout (no news is not good news), and need(RTT p50 over the same
//     span) <= d - 1, lowers d by 1. A raise within backoffWindowMs (30 s) of
//     a lowering doubles the hold (up to 120 s); a lowering that survives
//     backoffResetMs (60 s) resets it;
//   - counted stalls (what a peer reports) exclude events of hitchMs (1 s) or
//     longer (a load, a driver hang or an outage: at most 8 frames of delay
//     cannot hide them), stalls inside a lane S load window and stalls in
//     a settle span (the session's first frames and the first frames after
//     a B1 RESUME: time sync settling); all stay in the stats;
//   - lateness of THIS peer (a turn that starts behind its 30 Hz schedule:
//     a long tick such as a shader compile, a late wake-up on a loaded
//     machine) delays this peer's next inputs, and the peer duly reports the
//     wait. The delay is for the network, so the controller subtracts this
//     peer's own lateness (outside load windows, from selfLeadMs (1 s) before
//     the window on) from the reported lateness. (First clean-60 runs on a
//     machine shared with other lanes: 5.2 s of slow ticks on both peers in
//     one run, 0.1-0.4 s in the next.);
//   - need(rtt) is the handshake auto-delay formula, ceil((rtt/2)/33.3 ms -
//     0.05) + 1, clamped to [min, max], applied to the measured in-session
//     RTT minus one slot of turn quantization (Policy::rttBiasMs).
// The session freezes the controller (no change at all) during a B1 HOLD,
// inside a load window, mid-transition, and during a settle span. A HOLD,
// a load window or a settle span also restarts its clock
// (DelayController::note_pause), so the paused span never counts as
// evidence either way.
//
// SubmitGate is the frame arithmetic of a transition (the session and the
// two-session GekkoNet test both use it). GekkoNet's InputBuffer stores the
// input added at current frame c on c + delay and accepts only the next
// sequential frame. nextLand is that next frame; a submit is due when
// nextLand == advances + delay (the old sSubmitted == sAdvances gate when the
// delay never changes). Growing d -> d + k adds k + 1 inputs in one turn,
// setting GekkoNet's delay to d, d + 1, ... d + k before each add with
// gekko_set_local_delay_nofill, so each lands on the next frame. Shrinking
// d -> d - k sets the delay (GekkoNet touches no input) and submits nothing
// for k turns, until nextLand == advances + d - k again. Every frame gets
// exactly one local input, built in frame order, and the remote peer sees
// exactly this peer's buffer, so every transition is identical on both
// peers by construction. With a scripted input file the record for frame F
// is always record F - d0 (d0 the first delay), whatever the transitions,
// so scripted pairs replay the same per-frame inputs as a fixed-delay run.
